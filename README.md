# Calories-Prediction-Model

Certainly! Here's a README file for a GitHub repository focused on a calorie prediction model using machine learning:

Calorie Prediction Model
Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at predicting the calorie content of meals based on their ingredients and nutritional information. The goal is to develop a reliable predictive model that can assist in dietary planning and tracking.

Features
Data Collection: Scripts for collecting nutritional data from various sources.
Data Preprocessing: Tools for cleaning and preparing the data, including feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Jupyter notebooks with visualizations and statistical analyses to understand the relationships between ingredients and calorie content.
Predictive Modeling: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms to predict calorie content, including linear regression, random forests, and neural networks.
Model Evaluation: Metrics and methods for evaluating the performance of the predictive models.
Deployment: Scripts and configurations for deploying the model for real-time calorie prediction.

Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
git clone https://github.com/ashutoasst/calorie-prediction-model.git
cd calorie-prediction-model
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Data Collection: Run the data collection scripts to gather nutritional data.
Data Preprocessing: Use the preprocessing tools to clean and prepare the data for modeling.
EDA: Explore the data using the provided Jupyter notebooks.
Model Training: Train the predictive models using the training scripts.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using the evaluation tools to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Deployment: Deploy the best-performing model for real-time predictions.
